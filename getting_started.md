# Getting Started

You can install Retype using `npm`, `yarn`, or the `dotnet` CLI. 

Choose one of the following lines and run within your local Command line or Terminal:

```sh
# npm
npm install --global ********

# Yarn
yarn global add ********

# dotnet
dotnet tool install --global ********
```

Next, from your command line, navigate to a location where you have one or more Markdown `.md` files, then run the following sequence of commands. 

```
retype init
retype build
retype run
```

That's it! Your new Retype website should be up and running. 

:::

Obviously you will require either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable), or the [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) CLI to be installed before installing Retype. You only need one of those three, although all three could be installed on your machine too. It's up to you. :raised_hands:

All operating systems are supported, including Mac, Windows, and Linux.

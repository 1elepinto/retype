# Panel

A Panel is created by surrounding a block of content with `===` and including a `title` for the Panel.

This is a Panel. Expanded by default.

```

## Collapsed panel

By default, Panels are collapsible and will initially render in their expanded state. You can configure Panels to initially render in their collapsed state by using `++-` specifier.

```
==- My Panel
This is a collapsed Panel. :+1:
===
```

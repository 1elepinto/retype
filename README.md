# Welcome to Retype :smile:

[Retype](https://retype.com/) is an :sparkles: ultra-high-performance-magical :sparkles: generator that builds a website based on simple text files. Focus on your writing while Retype builds the rest. 

![Write anything, let Retype build the rest](static/retype-hero.svg)

No coding is required and just one Markdown file, such as a [`README.md`](https://www.makeareadme.com/), will get you started. 

The [retype.com](https://retype.com/) website was generated using Retype. View the [source](https://github.com/retypeapp/retype/blob/main/README.md) used to generate this very page.

A new Retype powered website can be up and running within seconds once Retype is installed, which itself takes only a few seconds. :+1:

!!!success COMING SOON

Retype can also build amazing reference documentation based upon your projects source code. TypeScript and C# projects are supported (JavaScript next), with plans for many more languages in the future.

Point Retype at a TypeScript or C# project, and reference documentation will be generated based on your library's source code, code comments, and metadata.

!!!

## Quick start

You can install Retype using `npm`, `yarn`, or the `dotnet` CLI. 

Choose one of the following lines and run within your local Command line or Terminal:

```sh
# npm
npm install --global retypeapp

# Yarn
yarn global add retypeapp

# dotnet
dotnet tool install --global retypeapp
```

Next, from your command line, navigate to a folder location where you have one or more Markdown `.md` files, then run the following commands.

```
retype init
retype build
retype run
```

That's it! Your new Retype website should be up and running. 

!!!

You will require either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable), or the [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) CLI to be installed before installing Retype. Only one of those three is required, although all three could be installed on your machine too. It's up to you. :raised_hands:

All operating systems are supported, including Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## Features

#### :tada: It just works

Retype has been built to be easy to use and should _"just work"_ out-of-the-box without any special configuration or troublesome setup.

#### :zap: Lightning fast

Don't blink. Retype was built for speed.

#### :white_check_mark: Easy install

[Installation](/getting_started.md) takes only a few seconds. Then you need at least one Markdown `.md` file which Retype will start building a new website from. 

#### :muscle: Powerful

Project level [configuration](project_configuration.md) using `retype.json` unlocks many more Retype features and customization.

#### :pencil2: Simple formatting

Pages are [formatted](/formatting.md) using Markdown syntax. Page level [configuration](/page_configuration.md) is available, such as customizing the navigation `label` or `description` used by search engines.

#### :computer: Host anywhere

Retype generates a basic HTML website that you can host on any web hosting service, such as [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site). No special server-side software or external dependencies are required. You can host your Retype site as a public website or as a private website inside your organization.

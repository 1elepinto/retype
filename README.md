# Welcome to Retype :smile:

Retype is an :sparkles: ultra-high-performance-magical :sparkles: generator that builds a website based on simple text files. This lets you focus on writing while Retype builds the rest. 

![Write anything, let Retype build the rest](static/retype-hero.svg)

No coding is required and just one Markdown file, such as a [`README.md`](https://www.makeareadme.com/), will get you started. 

View the [source](https://github.com/retypeapp/retype/blob/main/README.md) used to generate this very page.

A new Retype powered website can be up and running within seconds once Retype is installed, which itself takes but only a few seconds. :+1:

:::success COMING SOON
Retype can also build amazing reference documentation based upon your projects source code. TypeScript and C# projects are supported (JavaScript next), with plans for many more languages supported in the future.

Point Retype at a TypeScript or C# project, and reference documentation will be generated based on your library's source code, code comments, and metadata.

## Quick start

You can install Retype using `npm`, `yarn`, or the `dotnet` CLI. 

Choose one of the following lines and run within your local Command line or Terminal:

```sh
# npm
npm install --global ********

# Yarn
yarn global add ********

# dotnet
dotnet tool install --global ********
```

Next, from your command line, navigate to a location where you have one or more Markdown `.md` files, then run the following sequence of commands. 

```
retype init
retype build
retype run
```

That's it! Your new Retype website should be up and running. 

:::
Obviously you will require either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable), or the [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) CLI to be installed before installing Retype. You only need one of those three, although all three could be installed on your machine too. It's up to you. :raised_hands:

All operating systems are supported, including Mac, Windows, and Linux.
